# Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains a team project focused on analysing customer churn and building predictive models to identify at-risk customers. The goal was to understand key factors influencing churn, build models to predict churn likelihood, and provide actionable insights to reduce customer attrition.

## Project Overview

Key objectives of the project:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a customer dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to churn  
- Develop and evaluate predictive models to estimate the probability of customer churn  
- Identify the top customers most at risk of leaving and provide actionable recommendations  

Two predictive models were developed and evaluated to compare performance:  
- **Logistic Regression:** Initial model to establish baseline performance
- **Random Forest:** Optimised model with higher accuracy, used for scoring all remaining customers and ranking the top 500 most likely to churn
